This small hotfix addresses a **critical issue** with **M8S: Terrestrial rage**, specifically the **Half Rinon** strat and includes a few minor improvements and updates. If you've been running into problems with the **M8S: Terrestrial Rage** timeline, this should fix it.

## Changelog:

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed a critical issue where **Half Rinon** was broken due to an untested change before the last release.

### Other Changes

-   Made some **minor performance improvements** by updating a few animators to use **hashed animation names** instead of strings.
-   Added my **FFXIV character name** to the credits text on the main menu. :)
