This small update focuses on **polishing the in-game updater system**, improving clarity for update status, and addressing some timeline-specific issues. It also introduces the ability to **view changelogs directly in-game**.

## Changelog:

### New Features

-   Added a **button to the main menu** to manually **recheck for updates** at any time.
-   Update notifications now show both your **current version** and the **new version** for better clarity.
-   Added a button to **view the changelog** of a new update directly **in-game** after an update is detected.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed bot positioning logic in **M8S: Terrestrial Rage** for both **Rinon** and **Half Rinon** strats.
-   Fixed an issue where the **enemy list** in **M8S: Beckon Moonlight** would show incorrectly at the end of the mechanic.
-   Fixed the first mechanic (**spread/stack**) selector in **M8S: Terrestrial Rage**, which previously was not working at all.

### Other Changes

-   Improved the **estimated time remaining** and **download speed** display for the in-game updater. This is a **visual-only change**, but values should now be far more accurate and informative.
